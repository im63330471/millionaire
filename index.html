<!--
Prompts: Design a text-based trivia game to replicate 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' using simple code. 
Include a quiz with 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, starting easy and getting harder, with 4 answer options each. 
Add a scoring system where players earn points (e.g., 100 points per question, doubling to 1,000,000 for the last one). 
Include 3 lifelines: 50/50 (remove 2 wrong answers), Ask the Audience (a bar chart showing the percentage of votes for each option. 
In 90% of cases, the majority of the audience selects the correct answer), and Phone a Friend (give a 100% chance of a correct hint). 
Make it fun for kids, with a clear win message at the end if they reach the top score. Provide the code and a sample question list. 
Put it all in one standalone HTML file.
